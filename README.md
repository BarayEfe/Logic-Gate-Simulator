# Logic-Gate-Simulator
A project that simulates logic circuits using only AND and NOT gates.

You will start to create your own circuit using the basic AND and NOT gates. This may seem limited. However, with these two gates you can create any logic circuit possible. In order to help you create even the most complex circuits, I added a function that will let you package the gates you have created and use them modularly on more complex ones.
